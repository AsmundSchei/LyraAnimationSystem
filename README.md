I satup a animation system with the Lyra animations, using blueprints instead of the complicated setup from the actual Lyra starter game.
Purpose of this repo is to have a unbloated Lyra version with blueprints, and a FPS controller instead of the thirdperson setup.

Developed using UnrealEngine 5.4.
